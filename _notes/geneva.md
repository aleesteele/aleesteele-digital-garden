i recently discovered that borges lived in geneva. i'll be visiting his grave as a thesis break. [this beautiful essay](https://www.global-geneva.com/jorge-luis-borges-in-genevas-cemetary-of-the-kings/) has a lovely description of his time here.

geneva is full of surprises. 2 years on, i feel like i'm *just now* discovering things that make me feel more & more intrigued by this place. unlike when i was in [[amsterdam]], or even [[italy]], the weight of this place doesn't quite hit you in the same way.

there's so much more than what meets the eye.
