always thinking about this piece by ivan illych:

<blockquote>
If you have any sense of responsibility at all, stay with your riots here at  
home. Work for the coming elections: You will know what you are doing,  
why you are doing it, and how to communicate with those to whom you  
speak. And you will know when you fail. If you insist on working with the  
poor, if this is your vocation, then at least work among the poor who can  
tell you to go to hell. It is incredibly unfair for you to impose yourselves  
on a village where you are so linguistically deaf and dumb that you don't  
even understand what you are doing, or what people think of you. And it is  
profoundly damaging to yourselves when you define something that you  
want to do as "good," a "sacrifice" and "help."
