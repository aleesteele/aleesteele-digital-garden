been in amsterdam for [[wiki]] unlock. what a fascinating city â€“ center of merchant capitalism and the first stock exchange (which I learned about through <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HupDukQIugk&t=2651s'>this video</a>). 

thinking about the [[dutch east india company]] and the tulip fever + the way that markets determine behavior & societal openess to difference.
