what is the relationship between [[community]] and the curation of information? 

absolutely love [this article](https://sariazout.substack.com/p/check-your-pulse-55?s=r) by sari azout about the role of a new economy surrounding curation, [[knowledge management]], and [[community]].

<blockquote>We are living through the emergence of a new business category that doesn’t even have a name yet, but which I believe will become an important part of our digital lives: online communities at the intersection of content curation and knowledge management.</blockquote>

she brings up some really interesting points re: what happens when we try to navigate through [[information glut]]

<blockquote>There’s a whole economy around _knowledge organization_ available for the taking. 

Three intersecting problems remain unsolved: 
<br/>
1.  Our feed-based information architecture is obsessed with the present.
    <br/>
2.  We consume information recreationally, not as a way to achieve our goals.
    <br/>
3.  Curation has been too focused on the information and not enough on architecture; how we collect, store, augment, and utilize what’s already in our minds.</blockquote>
