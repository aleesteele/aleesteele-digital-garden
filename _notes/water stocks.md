A few quotes from a dystopian article from [forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneyshow/2021/07/22/let-your-profits-flow-with-these-top-5-water-stocks/?sh=6199775929d7)

``Water could be one of the biggest investing themes over the next several decades. An increasing global population is only going to cause demand for water to rise in the future.``

``And, given the fact that water is a necessity of human life, demand for water should hold up extremely well, even during the worst recessions. Therefore, investors with a longer time horizon should consider water stocks.``

``These factors make water stocks appealing for risk-averse investors looking for stability from their stock investments. In addition, all the water stocks on this list pay dividends and are likely to increase their dividends for many years in the future.````
