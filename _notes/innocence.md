I keep thinking about <a href="https://publicseminar.org/2017/01/the-politics-of-innocence/">this video on innocence</a> by miriam ticktin, about how the failure of the 1968 politics to materialize into real change has led to a kind of wild goose case over the latter half of the 20th century: where [[on humanitarians|humanitarian]] actors have tried to find increasingly more innocent actors to "save". Will revisit this.
