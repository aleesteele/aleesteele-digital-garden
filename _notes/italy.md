visiting D's family in italy. i must admit, because i have a dad that reads [[aristotle]] for fun, i've never taken to italy in the same way that he has.

maybe it's just having been in [[amsterdam]] a few weeks, ago, but I've been thinking a lot about what unbridled capitalism looks like. learning about the [[medici]] family and the decline of empire has been a good vehicle into that.

and of course, thinking about <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-sunday-read-davids-ankles/id1200361736?i=1000494339633">david's ankles</a> in florence.
