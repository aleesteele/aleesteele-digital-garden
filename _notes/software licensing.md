my dissertation has taught me a lot about the difference between the role of licenses. the first one i was exposed to was the [[mit license]]... then i learned more about the [[creative commons]] license and then [[database licensing]] (the kind that applies to osm)

all of this has a lot to do with how we think about intellectual property [intellectual property law]

what do they have to do with [[fair principles]]?
