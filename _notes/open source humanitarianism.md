a quote from the [[dissertation]]: "Similar to how open source software licensing has enabled the rapid multiplication and development of software, with licensing and attribution agreements ultimately tying respective uses to their makers, so is open source humanitarianism enabling the rapid inclusion of new voices and issues under the umbrella of humanitarian action, while keeping subsequent projects tied to humanitarian organizations in turn."

[[software licensing]] keeps coming back as a key legal mechanism through which 'ownership' over a project is/is not distributed.
