Was having a conversation the other day about 'liquidation', and how I'd associated it with taking value out of thin air – like selling stocks for cash. The other person said it was more so associated with the ability to flow between different states quickly.

Reminder to self – are there any other financial associations with water that i should be thinking about? [[water stocks]]?
