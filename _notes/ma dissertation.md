finally published my MA [thesis](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1486295668465483781)

to be honest – there's too much to catch up on to properly post it here. much of it happened in webs & drawings & on the page... and the webs of thought that spawned out of it. i'll add in some key terms though: [[open source humanitarianism]] + [[accumulation through incorporation]]

i'm going to be posting a summary on openstreetmap diaries (the internal blogging system of osm) – with a deeper especially, once i've reviewed some of the comments i received from people involved in osm

thinking more explicitly about networked citations here:
what started with [[hackers]] because a conservation with and [[humanitarian|on humanitarians]]... which became a conversation about [[innovation]] and [[humanitarian tech]]... and then [[open-street-map]] and the [[open]]
[[open-and-closed]]

somewhere in it all is the relationship with [[business and human rights]] and [[csr]], but that will take a bit longer to untangle
