finally published my MA [thesis](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1486295668465483781)

to be honest – there's too much to catch up on to properly post it here. much of it happened in webs & drawings & on the page... and the webs of thought that spawned out of it. i'll add in some key terms though: [[op]]

i'm going to be posting a summary on openstreetmap diaries (the internal blogging system of osm) – with a deeper especially, once i've reviewed some of the comments i received from people involved in osm

[[on humanitarians]]
[[open-street-map]]
[[open-and-closed]]
