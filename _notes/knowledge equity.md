Dr. Martin Dittus introduced me to the term knowledge equity a few weeks ago: the idea that access to knowledge is unevenly distributed across the globe, and especially on the web. Wikipedia has been a big pioneer of this, and has even added it to their <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction#Knowledge_equity:_Knowledge_and_communities_that_have_been_left_out_by_structures_of_power_and_privilege">internal policy</a>.
