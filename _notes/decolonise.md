have been listening to a few talks on decolonising [a.i.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMlnG5oXUnE&ab_channel=HarvardCarrCenterforHumanRightsPolicy) and [mapping](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/colonialism-in-open-data-and-mapping-tickets-141256414739#) and [academia](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/communications/events/decolonising-curriculum-and-racism-academia).

unpacking, learning. seems like i'm planting a lot of seed-thoughts these days, but not watering any of the roots.
