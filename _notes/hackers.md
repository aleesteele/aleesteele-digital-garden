I'm watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ&ab_channel=moviemaniacsDE">The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz</a>. In the era of library genesis and sci-hub (thank you Alexandra Elbakyan!), I'm just now beginning to realize how much of today's open access to information (relatively speaking) has been spearheaded by people like schwartz, and things like the [[guerilla open access manifesto]].
