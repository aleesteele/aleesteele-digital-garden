As someone that loves hiking, climbing, and all things that bring you outside, I often wonder about how my interest in human & machine and human & nature match up. Is it to look beyond the foibles of humans? Especially with the rising fear of automation and of the effects of climate change coming to the fore? 

But doesn't this betray my dedication to social justice? To ask questions beyond the human reminds me of billionaires like elon musk and jeff bezos (that only see space as the next frontier, and forget the rest of us on earth), and to forget the problems that afflict us today. I have to think about this.

Just a seed of a thought.
