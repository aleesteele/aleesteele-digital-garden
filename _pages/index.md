  <strong>Welcome to my digital garden.</strong> I'm a researcher and writer based in Geneva, Switzerland. If you'd like to learn more, check out my <a href="http://www.aleesteele.com/">main website</a>.

When I first heard about <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardening</a> and <a href="https://nesslabs.com/networked-thinking">networked thinking</a>, I was interested, but skeptical. To me, digital gardens felt like shadows of [[alhambra|the real thing]], and the fact they were published online made them feel less like a public space, and more like a performance. In the age of the attention economy, you can't blame me.

At the same time, I wondered if these digital methods could help to tend ideas, and help them to grow in a non-linear way. I liked the notion that we could make digital spaces that aren't simply collections of static pixels. I've also noticed that ecological language is being used all over the web these days: i.e. did you know that [[link rot|links can rot]]? Or that the internet is full of [[digital litter]]? 

This digital garden is a place to experiment with these and other ideas out in the open and in public, in case anyone might find them useful, or wants to <a href="mailto:aleesteele@gmail.com">tell me</a> what they're thinking. My more polished writing goes on my <a href="http://www.aleesteele.com/blog/">blog</a>. This is meant to be messy.
