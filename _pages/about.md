I'm currently a MA candidate at the [Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva](https://graduateinstitute.ch/anso){:target="\_blank"}. I'm also a Reproducible Research Fellow for the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://frictionlessdata.io/) and a journalist at [Geneva Solutions]().

Most of what I do focuses on how technology and the environment affect people and their politics (i.e. disaster & humanitarian tech, supply chains, and [#bizhumanrights](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bizhumanrights)). For me, this means working between disciplines, using modern tools to keep it accessible, and applying theory to practice. I do research, write articles, and reflect in public as much as I can. Sometimes, I make digital projects and take photographs in order to do the same thing.

Previously, I was Co-Editor-in-Chief of [The Graduate Press](http://thegraduatepress.org/). Before moving to Switzerland, I [researched conservation](/on-bhutan){: .internal-link} in Bhutan, [led student expeditions]() in Nepal, and [coded data visualizations]() for a Washington DC think tank. Before that, I helped music and arts festivals, and wrote a film script. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict under Saskia Sassen and designed media for student organizations and musicians in New York City. Once upon a time, I was a teen photographer and a swimmer.

Otherwise, I like to be outside, learn languages, and be as disconnected as I can.
